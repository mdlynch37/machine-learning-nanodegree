Since the already-coded `Environment.act()` flags `move_okay` depending on what action the agent wants to take and the state of the traffic light, I would have to change this method or write a new one (which does not make sense) to follow these instructions fully.\n",

    "However, we can more easily disregard the other inputs assessed outside of `Environment.act()` and assign random actions to our agent. By doing this we can see that our agent does make it to the destination in most cases. In the other cases it runs up against the `hard_time_limit` set to `-100`."

The main source of state variables are the current inputs at the intersection, but not all may require representation. You may choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the `self.state` variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcement `enforce_deadline` being set to `False`, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses."
