    "## Classification vs Regression Metrics\n",
    "- In classification we want to see how often a model correctly or incorrectly identifies a new example, whereas in regression we might be more interested to see how far off the model's prediction is from the real true value.\n",
    "- _Classification metrics_ include: accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.\n",
    "    - Using a set of data kept for testing, we can use these metrics on this testing set to measure which points were accurately classified, and which were not.\n",
    "- _Regression metrics_ include: mean absolute error and mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Metrics\n",
    "### Accuracy Score\n",
    "__definition:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{no. of data points labeled corrected}}{ \\text{all data points}} = \\frac{\\text{true positives + true negatives}}{ \\text{all data points}}$\n",
    "- Accuracy here is described as the proportion of items classified or labeled correctly.\n",
    "- Most basic and common classification metric\n",
    "- Default metric used in the `clf.score()` method in sklearn (\n",
    "- Can also use `sklearn.metrics.`[__`accuracy_score()`__](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortcoming of accuracy measurement:\n",
    "- Not good for skewed classes (i.e. most of the data under one label)\n",
    "    - because demoninator will be small, so measurement not trustworthy\n",
    "- Not suited to particular labeling requirements i.e. might want the metric to err on one label over the other.\n",
    "    - different performance metrics can focus on different types of errors (false positives, false negatives).\n",

    "## Regression Metrics\n",
    "- Regression scoring functions return values between 0 and 1, like classification metrics (better than error measurements in this way).\n",
    "    - Covered briefly for use in Boston Housing project\n",
    "- Regression error functions measure how close a regression model's prediction is to a true value. Lower value indicates better performance of a model in contrast to scoring functions.\n",

    "- in sklearn: `sklearn.metrics.`[__`mean_absolute_error()`__](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)\n",
    "- The average of the distances from predicted values to their true values (a.ka. _residual errors_).\n",
    "- _Absolute_ error is used to avoid canceling out errors from being too high or below the true values (similar to problem seen when using different methods to measure variance).\n",

    "- Most common metric to measure model performance. \n",
    "- In contrast with absolute error, the each residual error is squared.\n",
    "- Advantages of squaring each error:\n",
    "    - Error terms are positive\n",
    "    - larger errors are emphasized over smaller errors\n",
    "    - equation is differentiable, allowing calculus calculation of minimum and maximum values, which often leads to better computational efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The coefficient of determination (denoted by R<sup>2</sup>) is a key output of regression analysis. \n",
    "- It is interpreted as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n",
    "    - The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation (r) between predicted y scores and actual y scores; thus, it ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "    - With linear regression, the coefficient of determination is also equal to the square of the correlation between x and y scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning of return value:\n",
    "- A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 always fails to predict the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable.\n",
    "- Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the **target variable**, using this model, can be explained by the **features**.\n",
    "- *A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is no better than one that naively predicts the mean of the target variable.*\n",
