    "## Building a Student Intervention System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install\n",
    "\n",
    "This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)\n",
    "- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Template code is provided in the notebook `student_intervention.ipynb` notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run\n",
    "\n",
    "In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb```  \n",
    "```jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.\n",
